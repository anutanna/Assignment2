Hello everyone! Shopizon is made using NextJS React framework.
Let's dive in:

## After Cloning the Repo:

**First, install all the project and development dependencis by running the following command:**

```bash
npm install
```

**Second, you need to setup you MongoDB dev account. Do the following:**
1. Access the Database Access page for our cluster [Link](https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2/6835d98fbce7aa63bafce41c#/security/database)
2. Click on "Add new database user" (right-side of the page)
3. Add the username and password (I recommend to generate it)
4. Ensure the user has read and write roles in the Built-in Role section.
5. Click on "Add User"

**Third, let's update your .env file. You probably will not see one, but you will see a .env-example file.**
1. Rename this file to .env  (don't worry, because we already have added .env to the .gitignore file).
2. Substitute <db_username> and <db_password> with the ones for the user you just created (remove the angled brackets)
3. .env is now fully configured!

**Fourth, install VSCode Extensions:**
- (Mandatory) Prisma (prisma.prisma)
- Tailwind CSS IntelliSense (bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)
- ESLint (dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- ES7+React/Redux/React-Native snippets (dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets)
- Error Lens (usernamehw.errorlens)

**Finally, let's run it!**

1. Open you terminal and run the following
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## Good Stuff
- **Database:** to make everyone's lives easier, we will be using _Prisma ORM_ to manage our DB.
  - Don't worry about configuring it. It is already done.

  - We organzied server-side actions in the @/lib/actions directory. For now these are just CRUD for the DB. But other server-side interactions can be created (not necessarily for the DB):
    - db_order_actions.ts
    - db_order_item_actions.ts
    - db_product_actions.ts
    - db_user_actions.ts
    - db_vendor_actions.ts

    To use it is very simple. Check it out:
    - I have first imported the function to get the users (getUsers)
    - Then I ensured we had "async" in the component function definition, and "await" before calling the getUsers().
    - Next JS runs components on the server by default. If we need client-side components, we can add "use client" at the top, but usually only for small components that requires user interaction (e.g., buttons).

    ```js
    import { getUsers } from "@/lib/actions/db_user_actions";

    export default async function Home() {

      const users = await getUsers();

      return (
        <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-between p-24">
          <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">Users</h1>
          <ul>
            {users.map((user) => (
              <li key={user.id} className="py-2">
                {user.name} - {user.email}
              </li>
            ))}
          </ul>
        </main>
      );
    }
    ```

- **Branching:**
  - A new branch named "dev" is being introduced. When you are developing your features/components, please do the following:
    1. Checkout "dev". Ensure you are at the "dev" branch first.
    2. Run a git pull to obtain the latest and greatest from our repo.
    3. Create a new branch with your initials + task name
      - e.g., MA - Header Implementation

  - Expectation:
    - Well, taking the example above, it is expected that the branch "MA - Header Implementation" will carry several commits like "feat: implemented navbar", "feat: implemented search bar", etc. Don't just have a branch with one commit.

  - Merging to Dev:
    - As soon as you finalize your development, we can submit a merge request OR we can send a message on Teams and coordinate the merge during our meetings. [If you are a Git genius, please speak up!]. This part is not well defined, so let's use common sense and talk to each other before merging.
